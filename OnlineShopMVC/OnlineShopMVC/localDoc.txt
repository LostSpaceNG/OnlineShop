/// Authentication & Authorization ///

# ASP.NET Core Identity

# Custom User Model

	- ApplicationUser.cs: extends 'IdentityUser' to include additional custom fields (e.g. FullName, Address, etc.).

# View Models

	- LoginViewModel.cs
	- RegisterViewModel.cs

# Account Management

	- AccountController.cs: handles registration, login, logout and access-denied scenarios using 'UserManager' and 'SignInManager'.

# Role-Based Security

	- [Authorize(Roles = "Admin")] attribute: protects admin areas.
	- /Data/SeedRoles.cs: automatically creates and assigns roles on startup.

# Cookie & Session Management

	- Persistent authentication cookies (30-min lifespan) maintain user sessions.
	- Guest data (like shopping carts) is managed via session storage.

# Configuration

	- All services (Identity, Cookie Options, Session) are configured in Program.cs.



/// Shopping Cart ///

# Database Storage for logged-in users

/// Checkout and Order Processing ///

# Shipping Details
	
	- Users fill in their shipping address and select a payment method (Card or PayPal) on the checkout form.

# Order Creation 

	- The system collects the cart items (from session for guests or the database for logged-in users) and creates an 'Order' record with shipping details and the total amount.

# Order Items

	- Each item in the cart is recorded as an 'OrderItem', storing the product details, quantity, and price at purchase time.

# Payment Simulation

	- A 'Payment' record is generated using the user-selected payment method, simulating a successful transaction.

# Cart Clearance

	- After order placement, the cart is cleared from session storage or the database.

# Confirmation Page

	- Users are redirected to an Order Confirmation page displaying order details and the chosen payment method.

# Controllers and Models

	- Order.cs
	- OrderItem.cs
